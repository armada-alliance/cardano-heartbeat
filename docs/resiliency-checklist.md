***In order to determine the necessary skills, hardware, and good practices needed for a Stake Pool Operators to be more resilient to various unforeseen events that may take down their pools from the network we have broken the checklist into the following sections: Stake Pool Operations Recommended Skills and Resources, Resilience Options, and Redundancy***

# Stake Pool Operator Skills
- [ ] Network Engineering<details><summary></summary><br> A network engineer is a technology professional who is highly skilled in maintaining the connectivity of networks in terms of data, voice, calls, videos and wireless network services. These network engineers are also referred to as network architects. Our Network engineering description includes being accountable for formulating, implementing and executing the entirety of computer networks within an organization</details>


- [ ] System administration<details><summary></summary><br> A system administrator, or sysadmin, or admin is a person who is responsible for the upkeep, configuration, and reliable operation of computer systems; especially multi-user computers, such as servers. The system administrator seeks to ensure that the uptime, performance, resources, and security of the computers they manage meet the needs of the users, without exceeding a set budget when doing so. To meet these needs, a system administrator may acquire, install, or upgrade computer components and software; provide routine automation; maintain security policies; troubleshoot; train or supervise staff; or offer technical support for projects.</details>


- [ ] DevOps<details><summary></summary><br>
"By definition, DevOps outlines a software development process and an organizational culture shift that speeds the delivery of higher quality software by automating and integrating the efforts of development and IT operations teams â€“ two groups that traditionally practiced separately from each other, or in silos.<br>
In practice, the best DevOps processes and cultures extend beyond development and operations to incorporate inputs from all application stakeholders - including platform and infrastructure engineering, security, compliance, governance, risk management, line-of-business, end-users and customers - into the software development lifecycle."</details>
